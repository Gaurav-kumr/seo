<h1>What is SEO?</h1>
<p>The full form of SEO is Search Engine Optimization. SEO is basically to optimize your webpage for important and niche-related keywords and get relevant traffic by ranking your webpage on relevant keywords. For eg. For an IAS Coaching Institute in Delhi, "best IAS Coaching in Delhi" would be one of the important keywords to rank for traffic and conversion.</p>
